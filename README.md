##  Backend
We use backend as the bridge for our connectivity between database and apis used in front end. Server receives request from frontend and can accepts parameters through routes. These parameters are mostly ids. Server excutes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) to manage data. Server send a response after excuting a specific CRUD operation. The image shows a general idea about data processing when a route is invoked. This section we will describe the implementation of the backend project..

We developed the server in Node.js. See Apendix A to install this Node.js runtime environment as well as the ISMS project backend.
